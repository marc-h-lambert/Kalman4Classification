# The Recursive variational gaussian approximation (R-VGA)

## Object

This is the companion code for the paper "Recursive variational gaussian approximation (R-VGA)". The source of the library "Kalman Machine" which implement the assesed algorithms is available in python [here][0]. To reproduce some results just run [test][1]. To go further on this subject, a set of tutorial is also available [here][2] .
