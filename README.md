# The Recursive variational gaussian approximation (R-VGA)

## Object

This is the companion code for the paper \[1\]. The source of the library "Kalman Machine" which implement the assesed algorithms is available in python [here][0]. To test this library on an exemple case, run [TestKalmanMachine][1]. To reproduce the results of the paper run [PaperResults][2]. To go further on this subject, a set of tutorial is also available [here][3] (not yet published).
