# The recusrive variational Gaussian approximation

## Object

This is the companion code for the paper "Recursive variational gaussian approximation (R-VGA)". The code is available in python here. To reproduce some results just run .... To go further on this subject, a set of tutorial is also available just bellow. This tutorial introduce progressively our algorithm through the Kalman filtering approach for classification. 

### [[Part1]][1] Part 1: Data generation
- Generation of synthetic datas for the linear and logistic regression problem.
        
### [[Part2]][2] Part 2: Linear regression 
- The linear Kalman filter and equivalence with the online Newton.
        
### [[Part3]][3] Part 3: Logistic Regression
- The extended Kalman filter and equivalence with the online Natural gradient.
- The quadratic Kalman filter.
        
### [Part4] Part 4: the R-VGA approach
- The recursive variational Gaussian approximation.

## Ressources

Tutorial are written in jupyter notebook. You can read them from Git Hub but if you want to run the code you need to install locally jupyter notebook https://jupyter.org/ and download the tutorial files (.ipynb). The code of the Tutorial is also  available in the Kalman4ClassifLibrary. To test this library run...
