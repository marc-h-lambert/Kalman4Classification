# The Recursive variational gaussian approximation (R-VGA)

## Object

This is the companion code for the paper \[1\]. Please cite this paper if we use our code.  

## Installation
The code is available in python, we use the standard library and the "scipy" library to use optimization. If not available on your distribution, you may install scipy following https://www.scipy.org/install.html.

## python files
The source of the library "Kalman Machine" which implement the assesed algorithms is available in python [here][0]. To test this library on an exemple case, run [TestKalmanMachine][1]. To reproduce the results of the paper run [PaperResults][2]. 

## Tutorial in jupyter notebook
To go further on this subject, a set of tutorial is also available [here][3] (not yet published).
