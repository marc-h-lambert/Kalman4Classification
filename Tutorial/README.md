# Tutorial on Kalman filter for classification (To publish)

## Object
This tutorial introduce progressively the Kalman filtering approach for classification. 

### Part 1: Data generation
- Generation of synthetic datas for the linear and logistic regression problem.
        
### Part 2: Linear regression 
- Warm up on linear regression: introduce the linear Kalman filter and equivalence with the online Newton.
        
### Part 3: Logistic Regression
- The extended Kalman filter and equivalence with the online Natural gradient.
- The quadratic Kalman filter.
        
### Part 4: the R-VGA approach
- The recursive variational Gaussian approximation.

Tutorial are written in jupyter notebook. You can read them from Git Hub but if you want to run the code you need to install locally jupyter notebook https://jupyter.org/ and download the tutorial files (.ipynb). The code of the Tutorial is also  available in the Kalman4ClassifLibrary. To test this library run...
